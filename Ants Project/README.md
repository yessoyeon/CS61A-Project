# Ants Project

In this project, I will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

All of my changes will be made to ants.py.

- ants.py: The game logic of Ants Vs. SomeBees
- ants_gui.py: The original GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
- gui.py: A new GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees.
- graphics.py: Utilities for displaying simple two-dimensional animations
- utils.py: Some functions to facilitate the game interface
- ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A
- state.py: Abstraction for gamestate for gui.py
- assets: A directory of images and files used by gui.py
- img: A directory of images used by ants_gui.py
- tests: A directory of tests used by ok
