# Scheme Project

In this project, I will develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. 
I will also implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. 

This project includes several files, but all of my changes will be made to only four: scheme.py, scheme_reader.py, questions.scm, and tests.scm. Here are all the files included in the archive:

- scheme.py: implements the REPL and a evaluator for Scheme expressions
- scheme_reader.py: implements the reader for Scheme input. The Pair class and nil definition can be found here.
- scheme_tokens.py: implements the tokenizer for Scheme input
- scheme_builtins.py: implements built-in Scheme procedures in Python
- buffer.py: implements the Buffer class, used in scheme_reader.py
- ucb.py: utility functions for use in 61A projects
- questions.scm: contains skeleton code for Phase III
- tests.scm: a collection of test cases written in Scheme
- tests: a directory of tests used by ok
- mytests.rst: a file where you can add your own tests
